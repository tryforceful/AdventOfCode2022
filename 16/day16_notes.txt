The weighting of each node in the graph should be based on how much
pressure can be released cumulatively from (n=now -> 30 mins end time)
if we were to go and open its valve from where we currently stand.
So the weights change over time based on our location! Hmm

Should we always agnostically think only of the "next step forward",
or is there a better algorithm that keeps in mind very proximate clusters of
high-reward nodes?

EXAMPLE:

A - B - C - D - E - F - G - H
|           |
|-----------|
I
|
J

Represented in valve flow rates:

0 - 13 - 2 - 20 - 3 - 0 - 0 - 22
|             |
|-------------|
0
|
21

Determine shortest distance to each node,
determine time remaining if we visited that node and opened the valve
Multiply that remaining time by the flow of the valve
= total weight of node

Time is n = 0
Farthest distance is q = 5 in this scenario
Means max 6 seconds before new flow is added

0 - 13*28s - 2*27s - 20*28s - 12*27s - 0 - 0 - 22*24s
|                     |
|---------------------|
0
|
21*27s

Weights:

0 - 364 - 54 - 560 - 324 - 0 - 0 - 528
|               |
|---------------|
0
|
567

Uh oh. This didn't predict the right results :(
